## 🌟 Overview  
Millions suffer from multi-sensory disabilities, especially in rural areas. Our project aims to empower individuals with visual, hearing, or multiple impairments through an affordable, compact, and energy-efficient assistive device integrated with IoT technologies.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- Existing aids address one disability at a time.
- Lack of real-time tracking or emergency alerts.
- Devices are expensive or internet-dependent.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- Obstacle detection using **Ultrasonic sensor** with **vibration** + **LED** + **buzzer** feedback.
- **GPS** + **GSM (SIM800L)** for real-time location tracking and emergency alerts (even without internet).
- IoT dashboard via **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)** for remote monitoring.
- Compact, rechargeable using **Li-ion battery (7.4V)** and **buck converter**.
- Works in both rural and urban areas.
